# WinHeaven
**List/archive of great public tools (mostly programmatic) for windows. for making windows 11 and common applications work and look the way you want.**


Sometimes pinned versions of these tools are copied here as backups of the main repos, in case they get taken down. Concomitant instructions are included either from the OG repo or by me, if I found there was a simpler way to get the desired result or if its not explained anywhere.

Unfortunately i cant keep an up-to-date list, so whenever I have a working version I will try to add it to the archive and list here. For the latest versions obviously go to the individual projects' download pages. I will also only add small tools and files to the archive for storage reasons.
